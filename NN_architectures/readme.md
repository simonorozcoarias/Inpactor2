# Inpactor2: A software based on deep learning to identify and classify LTR-retrotransposons in plant genomes
## Neural network architectures utilized by Inpactor2
Each jupyter notebook contains the architecture of a neural network used in the software. Each notebook can be used for re-training, for seeing in detail the architecture, for adapting the network to other problems or for just reproducing the shown results.

Inpactor2 integrates those neural networks to perform the detection. filtration and classification of the LTR-retrotransposons automatically.
